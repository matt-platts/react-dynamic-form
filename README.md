# React-dynamic-form

There are two sets of code, App.js and AppTwo.js. AppTwo is supposed to fit into the table at the bottom of App, however the coding styles are very different and won't just merge.

You can test by copying AppTwo.js into App.js. A backup of App.js is already at App-backup.js so it can be reinstated.

I've not yet worked out how to run two pages in one react project so I'm stuck doing this!
